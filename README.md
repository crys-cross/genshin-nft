##About
This is Inspired from Genshin Impact Wish system. All trademarks and copyrights belong to Hoyoverse. This is for demo purpose to showcase the wish system on a blockchain and producing an NFT instead of just an ingame Character/Item. This follows a Gacha Mechanics pity system based on the said game based on the number of wishes. More details of the rate to follow.

##Mechanics
Press Mint Button in order to Wish for Characters

##Rates and Gacha System

1. Genshin Impact Rates are similar and not 1:1.
2. WishCounter(player's number of wish) will be for all users and not by individual players.
3. Every 10th pull guarantees a 4star or 5star. 90th pull for guaranteed 5star if no prior 5star minted.
4. Regular rate of 5% for 4star and 1% for 5star
5. 10th pull rate up of 98% for 4star and 2% for 5star
6. Increase chances for Collei, Beidou, Sayu and Nahida.

##Roadmap
